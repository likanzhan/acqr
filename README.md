This in progress r package contains a bunch of functions I wrote when I used R to do data analyses, to design behavioral experiments, or to teach statistics.

To install the `acqr` package, please run the following R code:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('likanzhan/acqr')
```
